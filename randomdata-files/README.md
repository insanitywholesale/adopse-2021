# Populate the application with random data
To test how well the code is written and how it handles lots of data, we use [gogenjson](https://gitlab.com/insanitywholesale/gogenjson).
It requires a template for the JSON we want to send as well as a YAML configuration to indicate what kind of random data to generate.
This directory includes all the necessary files required to run gogenjson and add data to the database.
